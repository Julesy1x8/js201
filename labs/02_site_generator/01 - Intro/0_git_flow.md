# Remember the Git Flow

In this course you'll be expected to follow the Git flow of:

- Creating a branch in your repository before you do make any changes
- Working on interdependent files in your branch
- Once finished on those files, creating a pull request
- Requesting a review from your tutor
- Starting another branch (from `master` or `main`) to continue working on something else

For more information, ask your tutor.
